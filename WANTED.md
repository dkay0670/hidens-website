# Wanted

This file details resources or just general help that is requested from me and/or others that'd benefit development/fix long-standing and/or severe issues.

## General fixes
- A proper fix for properly recognizing IPs behind reverse proxies, so that the Guestbook banning functionality can work if the site is behind a reverse proxy (like it is in [the live instance](https://hiden.pw)). This is one particular issue that has me running in circles, and any help with it would be greatly appreciated.
