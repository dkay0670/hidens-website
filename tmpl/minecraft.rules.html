<h1>Rules:</h1>

<ul>
	<li class=mcrule>Use common sense (i.e, don't spam, don't cheat/use hacks, say slurs/otherwise be offensive, be an all round dick, etc).</li>
	<li class=mcrule>Respect people of all backgrounds, qualities, etc. This kinda fits in rule 1 but still.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>Don't purposefully lag the server (i.e: DDoS, large explosions in-game, large redstone machines in-game, etc).</li>
	<li class=mcrule>If there's an idiot or a troll, quietly tell a mod so they can get them out painlessly.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>This server is run by a minor, so no NSFW content in the chat. Risque memes are fine, but downright porn isn't.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>You're responsible for your own actions.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>Ad-hoc rules can and will be made if you're annoying and/or an asshole.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>Pedophiles/zoophiles aren't allowed here.</li>
	<li class=mcrule>???</li>
	<li class=mcrule>Profit!</li>
</ul>
