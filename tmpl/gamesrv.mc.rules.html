<h1>Rules:</h1>

<ul>
	<li class=gsrule>Use common sense (i.e, don't spam, don't cheat/use hacks, don't grief, don't say slurs/otherwise be offensive, don't be discriminatory (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc), don't be an all round dick, etc).</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Respect people of all backgrounds, qualities, etc. This kinda fits in rule 1 but still.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Don't use hacks, exploits, cheats, etc to gain an unfair advantage or otherwise make the game unfun/unfair for other players.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Don't purposefully lag the server (i.e: DDoS, large explosions in-game, large redstone machines in-game, etc).</li>
	<li class=gsrule>If there's an idiot or a troll, quietly tell a mod so they can get them out painlessly.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>This server is run by a minor, so no NSFW content in the chat. Risque memes are fine, but downright porn isn't.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>You're responsible for your own actions.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Ad-hoc rules can and will be made if you're annoying and/or an asshole.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Pedophiles/zoophiles aren't allowed here.</li>
	<li class=gsrule>???</li>
	<li class=gsrule>Profit!</li>
</ul>
