			<p>My username is HIDEN/HIDEN64. I'm 15 years old, born on June 9, 2007. I'm an ever-so-slightly masc-leaning enby and my pronouns are they/he (they/them is very greatly preferred but he/him is okay too I guess). My sexuality is pansexual. I live in the south-central USA and I fucking hate it here. I'm a libertarian-socialist. I'm diagnosed with GAD and likely Tourettes too, and I possibly also have ADHD, OCD, and Autism.</p>
