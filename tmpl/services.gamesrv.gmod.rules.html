<h3>These are the rules for the Garry's Mod server. Generally, it just boils down to common sense:</h3><br>

<ul>
	<li>Don't use hacks, exploits, cheats, etc to gain an unfair advantage or otherwise make the game unfun/unfair for other players.</li>
	<li>Don't purposefully slow down the server (by DDOS, for example)</li>
	<li>No bigotry whatsoever, no matter what. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.</li>
	<li>No NSFW/NSFL content. Risque memes are fine, downright porn isn't.</li>
	<li>This server isn't your personal playground (it's everyone's playground, gameplay wise :P), don't bring your own drama and bullshit here.</li>
	<li>Try to stay civil when discussing something controversial like politics.</li>
	<li>Please don't backseat moderate. Leave moderation up to actual staff, as you're a mere peasant (/s).</li>
	<li>Ad-hoc rules can and will be made if you're annoying/an asshole. If a staff member/the general community tells you to knock it off/shut the fuck up and you don't, don't expect things to look pretty.</li>
	<li>...</li>
	<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>


<h4><i><u>In layman's terms, don't be a ding-dong.</u></i></h4>
