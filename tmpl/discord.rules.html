<h3>These are the rules for the Discord server. Generally, it just boils down to common sense:</h3><br>

<ul>
    <li class=servrule>Obviously, follow the <a class=servrule href=http://dis.gd/terms>Discord TOS</a>. If you're under 13 years old, you will be banned until your 13th birthday.</li>
    <li class=servrule>No bigotry whatsoever, no matter what. This includes racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.</li>
    <li class=servrule>No NSFW/NSFL content. Risque memes are fine, downright porn isn't.</li>
    <li class=servrule>This server isn't your personal playground, don't bring your own drama and bullshit here.</li>
    <li class=servrule>Try to stay civil when discussing something controversial like politics.</li>
    <li class=servrule>Try to stick to the channels' intended topic.</li>
    <li class=servrule>Please don't backseat moderate. Leave moderation up to actual staff, as you're a mere peasant (/s).</li>
    <li class=servrule>Ad-hoc rules can and will be made if you're annoying/an asshole. If a staff member/the general community tells you to knock it off/shut the fuck up and you don't, don't expect things to look pretty.</li>
    <li class=servrule>...</li>
    <li class=servrule>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<h4><i><u>In layman's terms, don't be a ding-dong.</u></i></h4>
