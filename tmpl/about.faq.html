<p class=faqtxt>Q: <em>Why did you make this site, and how is it hosted?</em></p>
<p class=faqtxt>A: I was bored one day, and I wanted my own space on the massive superhighway of the internet, so why not :P.<br><br>
                An ex-friend of mine allowed me to host the site on his secondary PC, until I switched hosts to GitHub pages after a month.<br><br>
                A few months after that, I started self-hosting the site, which I still do to this day.</p>

<br><br>

<p class=faqtxt>Q: <em>Why does it look all outdated? Why not use modern design?</em></p>
<p class=faqtxt>A: Personally, I Hate modern web design with a capital H.<br><br>
                Many modern websites look like they were thrown together in Microsoft Paint in 30 seconds, and then turned the resource usage and thrasing up to 11.<br><br> 
                Oh, and don't forget the absurd amount of pop-ups, ads, tracking, and data-mining/selling!<br><br>
                The old internet was when sites had personality, and the internet wasn't some coporate breeding ground. I much prefer this era... despite me being born near the end of it.<br><br>
                So basically, I'm trying to relive the old days, when you could say, do, and find anything and have fun exploring the internet, and without any ads, tracking, or similar.<br><br> 
                Unlike nowadays where most people are relegated to 3 - 6 sites, most of those harvest your data and sell them for a profit (Looking at you, Facebook/Meta, TikTok, and Google.), as well as bombard you with ads and other pop-ups.
