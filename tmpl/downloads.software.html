			<p>Windows Media Player is a media player that is included with Microsoft Windows. It was replaced by Groove Music/Movies & TV in Windows 10, but it was pretty much revived in Windows 11. Get version <a href=/storage/software/wmp/7/wmp7.exe>7</a>, <a href=/storage/software/wmp/9/wmp9.exe>9</a>, <a href=/storage/software/wmp/10/wmp10.exe>10</a>, or <a href=/storage/software/wmp/11/wmp11.exe>11</a>.</p>

			<img class=softwareicon src=/static/icon/software/winamp.png alt="Winamp icon" title="Winamp icon">
			<p>Winamp</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Winamp is a legendary media player originally created by Nullsoft, and then later sold to AOL in 1999, and then again sold to Radionomy in 2014. Sadly, it's deep into the ponzi scheme that is NFTs these days. Choose what version of Winamp you want <a href=/downloads/software/winamp>here</a>.</p>

			<img class=softwareicon src=/static/icon/software/frontpage.png alt="FrontPage 2003 icon" title="FrontPage 2003 icon">
			<p>Frontpage</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Frontpage was a program by Microsoft that made building websites very easy, with some features from other applications in the Microsoft Office suite. It's not as useful in the current day considering it utlizied IE's own HTML extensions that have obviously been phased out by the late 2000s, but it's still fun. It also repersents my favorite era of the internet (90s - early to mid 00s), so there's that. Get it <a href=https://download854.mediafire.com/jf4fcsv99osg/lspp007v5kyg2a5/FrontPage2003.exe>here</a>.</p>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<img class=softwareicon src=/static/icon/software/netscape.png alt="Netscape icon" title="Netscape icon">
			<p>Netscape</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Netscape is a discontinued internet suite, and was the main competitor to Internet Explorer in the 1990s and early 2000s. It's market share dropped sharply in the late 1990s due to IE gaining traction, because it was bundled with Windows and, at the time, Mac OS (which eventually led to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.>antitrust lawsuit Microsoft received by the USA government in 2001</a>). It was eventually superseded by Mozilla Firefox (which was a lot more successful against IE). Get version <a href=/storage/software/netscape/7.2/NSSetup-Full.exe>7.2</a>.</p>

			<p>RetroZilla</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>RetroZilla is a fork of the old Mozilla internet suite that has been updated with a modern version of the Gecko browser engine, to allow fossils of machines to browse the modern web. Get version <a href=/storage/software/retrozilla/2.2/retrozilla-2.2.en-US.win32.installer.exe>2.2</a>.</p>

			<img class=vpcicon src=/static/icon/software/vpc.png alt="Windows Virutal PC icon" title="Windows Virtual PC icon">
			<p>Virtual PC</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Virtual PC was a hypervisor originally developed by Connectix, but later sold to Microsoft. It was (sort-of) replaced by Hyper-V. Get version <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/setup.exe>2007</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want to run it on Windows 8 or higher, change the setup file's name to something else, do the same thing for the program's executable. If you're running the x86 version of Windows 8 - 10, you don't need to do anything else. However, if you use x64 8/8.1, you also need to replace VMM.sys in your <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers</code> folder with <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vmm.zip>this updated version</a>. <u>This does not work on the x64 version of Windows 10, only the x86 version. It does not work on Windows 11.</u></p>
			<p>If you want the rollup that adds some extra goodies, such as fullscreen 1080p and fixes to networking, get that <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vpc2007sp1_rollup.zip>here</a>. Replace the files in your installation directory with these.</p>

		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Speakonia was a Text-to-Speech (TTS) program created by CFS-technologies, initially released in 2002(?). The final version (1.0.3.6) was released in 2008. It utilises the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), specifically version 4 of it.</p>
			<p>Although quite outdaetd and unsupported, it is still very popular among the TTS community. Get it <a href=/storage/software/speakonia/speakoniasetup-1.0.exe>here</a>.</p>
