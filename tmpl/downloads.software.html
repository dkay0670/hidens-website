			<p>Frontpage</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Frontpage was a program by Microsoft that made building webistes very easy, with some features from other applications in the Microsoft Office suite. It's not as useful in the current day considering it utlizied IE's own HTML extensions that have obviously been phased out, but it's still fun. Get it <a href=https://download854.mediafire.com/jf4fcsv99osg/lspp007v5kyg2a5/FrontPage2003.exe>here</a>.</p>

			<img class=softwareicon src=/static/icon/software/netscape.png alt=netscape.png>
			<p>Netscape</p>
		</td>
		<td>
			<p>Netscape is a discontinued internet suite, and was the main competitor to Internet Explorer in the 1990s and early 2000s. It's market share dropped sharply in the late 1990s due to IE gaining traction, because it was bundled with Windows and, at the time, Mac OS. It was superseded by Mozilla Firefox. Get version <a href=/storage/software/netscape/7.2/NSSetup-Full.exe>7.2</a>.</p>

			<p>Virtual PC</p>

			<p>Virtual PC was a hypervisor originally developed by Connectix, but later sold to Microsoft. It was (sort-of) replaced by Hyper-V. Get version <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/setup.exe>2007</a>.</p>
			<p>If you want to run it on Windows 8 or higher, change the setup file's name to something else, do the same thing for the program's executable. If you're running the x86 version of Windows 8 - 10, you don't need to do anything else. However, if you use x64 8/8.1, you also need to replace VMM.sys in your <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers</code> folder with <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vmm.zip>this updated version</a>. <u>This does not work on the x64 version of Windows 10, only the x86 version. It does not work on Windows 11.</u></p>
			<p>If you want the rollup that adds some extra goodies, such as fullscreen 1080p and fixes to networking, get that <a href=/storage/software/vpc/2007/vpc2007sp1_rollup.zip>here</a>. Replace the files in your installation directory with these.</p>
